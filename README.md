### Phylogenetic Stochastic Simulation Algorithm 
---
This algorithm uses Gillespie/Rejection/Composition-Rejection updates
to simulate evolving communities with meshless/arrayless data structures under
various phenomenological yet reasonable ecological and evolutionary processes.

The current implementation includes birth, death, competition with NN kernel along X, innovation with NN kernel along X and Y, and environmental catastrophies along Y.

## Requirements
* pyprocessing
* sortedcontainers
